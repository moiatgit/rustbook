error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*un_string` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
 --> src/main.rs:8:5

  |                        ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut String`

  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `un_string` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
